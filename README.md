## 🏆 Featured Solutions
*Here are a few problems where I demonstrated optimized logic:*

### 1. SQL: Analyzing Employee Salaries
**Source:** [Link to problem, e.g., DataLemur]
* **Challenge:** Identify employees earning more than their managers.
* **Solution Approach:** Used a self-join on the Employee table to compare salaries within the same row context.
* **[Link to Code](./SQL/Medium/employees_earning_more.sql)**

### 2. Python: Two Sum (Optimized)
**Source:** LeetCode
* **Challenge:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target.
* **Solution Approach:** Implemented a **Hash Map** approach to achieve **O(n)** time complexity, improving upon the brute force O(n²) method.
* **[Link to Code](./Python/Easy/two_sum.py)**
